## UPDATE 1.1 [01/01/2022]
We have made some improvements on the thermal capturing node:
```
* Extend the bounding box contour [based on the Dev's faces references]
* Capture only the maximum thermal data value of forehead region [circa 1/3.3 of the bounding box height]
* Capture one frame only out of every 11 captured frames [11th frame]
* Conduct optimal nominal distance for participants: 40-50cm away from the cameras
```
